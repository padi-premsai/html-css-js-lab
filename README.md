# HTML-CSS-JS Lab

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects, UI experiments, and reusable components built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each folder includes a standalone demo with:

- `index.html` â€“ main HTML file
- Optional `style.css` and `script.js`
- A `README.md` describing the purpose and usage of the demo

---

## ðŸ“‚ Organization

Each demo is placed in its own folder under the root of this repository. You can browse each folder individually to explore different UI elements, effects, or layout experiments.

All demos are standalone and runnable directly in the browser â€” just open the `index.html` file.

## âœ… Notes

- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” no frameworks used.
- Easy to copy, modify, and reuse for learning or real-world projects.
